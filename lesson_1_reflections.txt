How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug thatwas introduced?

Because you are able to compare files side by side a literally compare the differeces.  Also, Diff, shows you the differences between each file with a + and - symbolising added and not there.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because you are able to see previously used code that wasnt as efficent or error prone, preventing you from making the same mistake twice.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

The differece being the validity of the change, for instance, automatic changes maybe be inappropriate to the the actual change.  hence, manual changes with meaning are more relevant to the change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

This breaks things down into seperate steps...

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log provides details of versions committed, and git diff illistrates the differences between them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Well if you break something it is easy to revert back to a previous version, so, get stuck in, use Git and work away.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

to work alongside any coding projects that i am planning in the near future.
