When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be for all to see; possibly a final and finished version.  where as a local copy would be something that you are working on that hasnt been finished as of yet.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

With manual deploys, you can create an immediate deployment of any branch at any time; if you want to control when changes are deployed.
With automatic deploys, you build and deploy all pushes you have developed. Some times; i am guessing, this process could occur before any final checks have been completed. Pushing inaccurate, erroneous information.
